# # The Distributed Movie Theater High Availability and Software Crash Recovery  
is a robust and fault-tolerant system designed to ensure uninterrupted functionality in a distributed theater environment. The system comprises three server components, allowing it to continue providing answers even if one of the servers goes down.

To enhance reliability, the project incorporates a fault tolerance mechanism that verifies the accuracy of responses received from each server. This mechanism ensures that erroneous or inconsistent responses are detected and mitigated, guaranteeing the delivery of reliable information to clients.

The implementation leverages various concepts from distributed systems, including multicast communication for efficient message dissemination, a total order algorithm to ensure consistent ordering of messages, and the UDP protocol for fast and lightweight communication between servers.

Furthermore, the project utilizes CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) for seamless communication between the client and server components. This enables transparent and standardized interactions, simplifying the development and integration process.

By combining these technologies and concepts, the Distributed Theater High Availability and Software Crash Recovery project achieves a resilient and dependable system that maintains uninterrupted operation, enhances fault tolerance, and provides a seamless experience for theater management and clients alike.
